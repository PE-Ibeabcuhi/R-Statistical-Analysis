# R-Statistical-Analysis
Welcome to the Statistical Analysis project! This repository contains the code and documentation for conducting a comprehensive statistical analysis of a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

About the Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed here. It contains [brief description of dataset].

What We Did
During this analysis, we performed a variety of tasks to gain insights into the data:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. This involved summary statistics, data visualization, and identifying patterns and trends.

Outlier Detection: We employed both Chebyshevâ€™s rule and Box plot methods to identify outliers in the dataset. Outliers can significantly affect statistical analysis and decision-making, so it was important to detect and handle them appropriately.

Exploration of Probability Distributions: We explored various probability distributions present in the dataset. Understanding the underlying distributions of variables is crucial for modeling and making statistical inferences.

Hypothesis Testing: Several hypothesis tests were conducted to validate assumptions and make inferences about the dataset. Hypothesis testing is a key component of statistical analysis and helps in making data-driven decisions.
